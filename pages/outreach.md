I thrive at the intersection between science and the public. I have a passion for science communication and engaging all ages in the thrills of scientific discovery. Throughout my career I have sought out opportunities to participate in and coordinate events that bring astronomy to the public. I have spent hundreds of hours participating in and organizing outreach activities and events such as the following:
* co-founding and leading outreach programs
* large community events at museums, the Kennedy Space Center, and universities
* school visits
* workshops to train educators in the astronomical sciences
* making videos to explain my scientific results
* guest speaker
* public stargazing night volunteer

Something that is important to me is that not only professional astronomers understand my research, but that a public audience also feels that they can understand my research. To this end, I have made two videos concerning my research for the public audience:
* A 10 minute video explaining what a radio galaxy is with the public being the intended audience: [Radio Galaxies](https://youtu.be/2_HBLgb_198)
* An 8 minute video summarizing my work with quasars with the public being the intended audience: [Cosmic Scrapbook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YevdrRTempc&list=PLA0VnboNRbqrdInv5BSiO11gMh9esvKYA&index=1)

In early 2016, I participated in the [AAS Astronomy Ambassador Program](https://aas.org/education/aas-astronomy-ambassadors-program) which gave me the tools and skills in order to explain complex astrophysics concepts using ordinary, every-day objects. I highly recommend this workshop and program and can't thank the founders and facilitators enough for this workshop.

After this workshop, several colleagues and I went back to the University of Florida and formalized the founding of the UF Astronomy Outreach program. Then, two colleagues and I applied for and recieved the University of Florida's Bob Graham Center H3C Initiative Grant in which we created an outreach program called, Springs & Stars. In this program, we took our educational star gazing events to three Florida State Parks in order to bridge the gap between education hubs, underserved rural areas, and Floridaâ€™s public parks by improving access to and engagement in science.
